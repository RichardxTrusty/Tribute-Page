                    <div class="thumbnail-text">Paul Bogle (1820 – 24 October 1865) was a Jamaican Baptist deacon and
                        activist. He is a National Hero of Jamaica. He was a leader of the 1865 Morant Bay protesters,
                        who marched for justice and fair treatment for all the people in Jamaica. After leading the
                        Morant Bay rebellion, Bogle was captured by government troops, tried and convicted by British
                        authorities under martial law, and hanged on 24 October 1865 in the Morant Bay court house.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1822</strong> - Paul Bogle was born in Stony Gut, St Thomas to a community of small
                            farmers.</li>
                        <li><strong>1834</strong> - Paul Bogle grew up in a time of transition in Jamaica with slavery
                            being abolished but power still remained in the hands of the white population
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Although Black Jamaicans could vote in reality the requirement to be able to read
                                    and write
                                    and the high fee for voting excluded most of them from being able to vote.

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1864</strong> - Jamaica suffered two years of drought in 1863-64 with the poorest
                            farmers hit hard and rumours started to surface that the white land owners intended to bring
                            back slavery.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In the elections of 1864 black Jamaicans out-numbered white by 32 to 1 but very few
                                    actually had the opportunity to vote.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>1865</strong> -On 7th October a black Jamaican was charged with and found
                            guilty of trespassing on a long abandoned plantation. The local population protested about
                            this and a group from the village of Stony Gut freed the man by force. Returning to their
                            village Bogle discovered that the 27 men of the village now had warrants for arrest for a
                            range of offences including rioting, and assaulting the police.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    On October 11 Paul Bogle lead 200-300 black men and women into the town of
                                    Morant Bay, in what became known as the Morant Bay Rebellion. Bogle’s group marched
                                    to the court house to protest about the arrest warrants but were met by a local
                                    militia who in panic opened fire and killed seven of the protesters. This sparked a
                                    riot during which another 18 people died. What started as a protest became a
                                    rebellion, with the town under the control of the rebels whose numbered quickly
                                    swelled to over 2000, with another two deaths in the following days.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li> The White planter population feared that the revolt would spread to the rest of Jamaica and
                            the British Governor of Jamaica Edward Eyre sent troops to quickly put down the uprising. In
                            reality the uprising had now calmed and was far from the armed insurrection perceived by the
                            white population and the troops met little resistance but this did not prevent a brutal
                            response with many deaths among the black population whether they had been involved in the
                            uprising or not.</li>
                        <li> The statistics are grim - 439 black Jamaicans were killed by troops, 354 black Jamaicans
                            were arrested and later executed and 600 punishments including floggings and prison
                            sentences were carried out.</li>
                        <li>Paul Bogle was one of those arrested and later executed, while his friend and supporter
                            George Gordon, who had very little to do with the uprising, was arrested in Kingston, tried
                            under martial law and hanged on October 23rd. The rebellion and its effects had a huge
                            impact on Jamaica and Britain at the time. In Britain it caused public debate with views
                            being polarized into two camps - those supporting Governors Eyre’s response and those who
                            believed that he should be tried for murder.</li>
                        <li><strong>1866</strong> - In August 1866 Eyre returned to the UK. Those opposed to his actions
                            set up the Jamaica Committee; this included various liberal politicians including Charles
                            Darwin and John Stuart Mill. Eyre was in fact charged twice with murder but the charges
                            never got to trial. In Jamaica what started as a small riot led to the Jamaican Assembly
                            renouncing its charter and Jamaica becoming a crown colony.
                        <li><strong>1991</strong> - Paul Bogle was later named a National Hero of Jamaica and his head
                            appeared on the Jamaican $2 note from 1969 until it was phased out in 1989, and on the 10c
                            coin since 1991. </li>
